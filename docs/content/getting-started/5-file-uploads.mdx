title: File Uploads
---

You thought handling post data and zero-config api routes are awesome? How about
easy-peasy file uploads?

## handle Â» upload

To enable file uploads, we'll accompany the `post` handler with an `upload`
handler. Together, they'll be responsible for handling multipart form
submissions.

```js
import fs from 'fs';
import { handle, json } from 'next-runtime';

export const getServerSideProps = handle({
  async upload({ file, stream }) {
    stream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(`/uploads/${file.name}`));
  },

  async post({ req: { body } }) {
    return json({ message: 'Thanks, file accepted!' });
  },
});
```

The `upload` handler gets a file object containing name, type and size
properties, as well as a readable stream. Either use the stream to write the
file to your file system, or pipe it to an object store like S3.

If you wish to store the file locally, you might also simply specify the
`uploadDir` instead, and let `next-runtime` handle the writing for you. More
about that, on the api pages.

Possibly unnecessary, but here's a form that could be submitting data to this
handler:

```jsx
export default function MyPage({ name, message }) {
  if (message) {
    return <p>{message}</p>;
  }

  return (
    <form method="post" encType="multipart/form-data">
      <input name="file" type="file" />
      <button type="submit">submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

Don't forget to specify `encType="multipart/form-data"` when adding file inputs.

Just as with the standard `post` handler, this form can be upgraded to a `Form`
as well. Please see
[data updates - upgrading to form](/getting-started/4-data-updates#upgrading-to-form)
for how to do that.
