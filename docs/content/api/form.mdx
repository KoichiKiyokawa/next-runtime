title: Form Component
---

The `Form` component can be used to upgrade your HTML `<form>`. Note that it
posts the form data to the current page path, so it's meant to be use in
conjunction with `handle` to process post data in `getServerSideProps`.

It does not do any client side state management. It's as much as an alternative
to full fletched form libs, as it is not. The philosophy of `next-runtime` is to
do more on the server, and less on the client. Simpler form handling is part of
that.

When using `Form`, we recommend to use `defaultValue` to set initial values, and
to not use `value` or `onChange` handlers. Read
"[simple form handling in react](https://dev.to/smeijer/simple-form-handling-in-react-o72)"
to read more about that approach.

```jsx
import { Form } from 'next-runtime/form';

function MyPage() {
  return (
    <Form method="post">
      <input name="name" defaultValue={name} />
      <input name="country" defaultValue={country} />
      <button type="submit">submit</button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

## Props

`Form` takes the following props. All props are optional.

- **name** _string_

  The name is a standard html prop, but in addition to that it's also used to
  tie forms and [`useFormSubmit`](/api/use-form-submit) together. Usage is
  optional, but recommended.

- **method** _get | post | put | patch | delete_

  The method to use for form submissions. `get` appends the form-data to the URL
  in name/value pairs, while other http methods include the FormData in the
  request body.

  Unlike the standard html form, method defaults to `post`, and all http methods
  are supported.

- **onSubmit** _(event: FormEvent) => void_

  A callback that's invoked before form submission. It receives the raw `event`
  from React. This function can be used for validation. Call
  `event.preventDefault` to block the form from being submitted to the server.

- **onSuccess** _(state: FormState) => void_

  Called on successful form submission. It receives the form state as an
  argument.

- **onError** _(state: FormState) => void_

  Called when an error occurs (non 2xx status). It receives the form state as an
  argument.
