title: Form Component
---

The `Form` component can be used to upgrade your HTML `<form>`. Note that it posts the form data to the current page path, so it's meant to be use in conjunction with `handle` to process post data in `getServerSideProps`. 

It does not do any client side state management. It's as much as an alternative to full fletched form libs, as it is not.

The philosophy of `next-runtime` is to do more on the server, and less on the client. Simpler form handling is part of that.

When using `Form`, we recommend to use `defaultValue` to set initial values, and to not use `value` or `onChange` handlers. Read "[simple form handling in react](https://dev.to/smeijer/simple-form-handling-in-react-o72)" to read more about that approach. 

```jsx
import { Form } from 'next-runtime/form';

function MyPage() {
  return (
    <Form method="post">
      <input name="name" defaultValue={name}/>
      <input name="country" defaultValue={country}/>
      <button type="submit">submit</button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

## Props

`Form` takes the following props. All props are optional.

- **method** _get | post_

  The method to use for form submissions. `get` appends the form-data to the
  URL in name/value pairs, while `post` sends the form-data as an HTTP post
  transaction. Defaults to `post`

- **validate** _(formData: FormData) => boolean_

  A callback that's invoked before form submission. Return `false` when the
  form data is invalid, and the form should not be submitted.

- **onSuccess** _(response: Record<string, unknown>) => void_

  A callback that's invoked upon successful submission. Can be used to update
  the page or invoke a redirect. `response` the json payload returned from the
  `post` handler.

- **onError** _(error: string) => void_

  A callback that's invoked when the form errors on the server side. Can be
  used to show an error message. `error` is a string containing statusCode & statusText

- **shallow** _boolean_

  Submit the form without updating the current page. The form will still be reset, but the `get` handler is not rerun. Defaults to `false`.

## usePendingFormSubmit

A hook that provides access to the data that is currently being submitted. This allows you to create fancy loading screens.

```jsx
import { usePendingFormSubmit } from 'next-runtime/form';

function MyPage() {
  const pending = usePendingFormSubmit();
  
  if (pending) {
    return (
      <p>
        {`Currently submitting ${pending.data.get('name')}`}
      </p>
    );
  }
  
  // ...
}
```
