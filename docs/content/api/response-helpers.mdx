title: Response Helpers
---

next-runtime includes a few convenient helpers to increase the readability of
your return statements. Usage is recommended, but entirely optional.

As they simply transform your input object to a shape that next understands, you
may also use them in the standard `getServerSideProps` functions if you want.

## json

Wraps the input object in `{ props: { ... } }`, which are then provided as props
to the page component.

```js
import { json } from 'next-runtime';

export const getServerSideProps = () => {
  // { props: { hello: 'world' } }
  return json({ hello: 'world' });
};
```

## redirect

Redirect translates your destination path and options to the redirect object
that Next understands.

The options are optional, and `permanent` defaults to false.

```js
import { redirect } from 'next-runtime';

export const getServerSideProps = () => {
  // { redirect: { destination: '/other-page', permanent: false } }
  return redirect('/other-page');
};
```

## notFound

Return this statement when you want to show the user that this page doesn't
exist. Either because it really doesn't, or they shouldn't know it does because
they lack permissions.

```js
import { notFound } from 'next-runtime';

export const getServerSideProps = () => {
  // { notFound: true }
  return notFound();
};
```
