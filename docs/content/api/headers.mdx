title: Headers
---

We have added a `getHeader` and a typed `setHeader` method to the request and
response objects.

## req.getHeader

Next.js already has the dictionary lookup like `req.headers['referer']`, we've
simply wrapped that method because `getCookie` & `getHeader` looks cleaner than
`req.getCookie` and `req.headers['']`.

```js
export const getServerSideProps = handle({
  async get({ req }) {
    const referrer = req.getHeader('referer');
  },
});
```

## res.setHeader

This one is actually Next.js own. Except, we've typed it so you can enjoy auto
completions. No more typo's!

```js
export const getServerSideProps = handle({
  async get({ res }) {
    res.setHeader('cache-control', 'max-age=300');
  },
});
```
